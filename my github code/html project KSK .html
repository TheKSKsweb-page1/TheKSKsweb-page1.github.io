			It is also one of the world's most controversial dam projects as it involves a long-running international dispute between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan over the Blue Nile water sharing 
			<br>Ethiopia accounts for more than 80% of the Blue Nile water in its territory alone and the downstream countries Egypt and Sudan fear the dam construction will reduce the water flow on 
			</br>the river and cause drought-like situations in their territories.
